# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To make sure that my code is is functional and secure I will want to do code review and testing. The code reviews are static testing making sure that my code no big coding errors. Then testing more specifically dynamic testing to make use that code works as intented. These steps in unison will help me to ensure that my code is functional and secure.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

In order to be interpret the users needs you need to make sure that you communicate with the clients or make sure that you are reading and disecting any requirements sent to by the client. In the case of this assingment I made sure to just disect the requirements. This is the best way to make sure that you follow what the users needs.


# How do I approach designing software?

I approch designing software the same as most I assume. I start by first trying to get a full understaning of the requirements. This helps to give the foundation for which I will make the software. Then I usually try to diagram it out this is to help make sure that I am understaning where I want the object to go. This lets me see where and how I want the program to work. Then I usually start the coding process. As I am going through I ususally do check my work this would be like a code review. Then as I finish a piece of the code I test it to make sure that each unit of the code is working the way that I intented for it to work. This is the process that I usually take when desinging software.
